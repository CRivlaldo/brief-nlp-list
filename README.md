# brief-nlp-list

An idea of this list is to have a minimal set of resources dedicated to Natural Language Processing must have to study. And to provide several links for further studying. 

## Books

- [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) – The popularly acclaimed bible for traditional NLP
- [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) – More practical book


## Videos
- [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9780134851921/) – Introduction to processing natural language with Deep Learning (it's possible to use 10 days free trial to watch these videos)
